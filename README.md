A kotlin implementation of the MENACE Tic-Tac-Toe matchbox learning machine (Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine), originally built with matchboxes in 1961 by Donald Michie.

This is purely a toy project, to facilitate the education in machine learning and the Kotlin language by the author(s). The system has been implemented before in JavaScript and other languages, though, to make the excercise worthwhile, those implementations have not been examined by the author(s).

Also, putting lots of beads in matchboxes is exhausting and tiresome, while coding is fun!
